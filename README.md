    AgroPlace is a full-stack e-commerce for agricultural products focused on the LATAM market. Developed with a team of 10 programming students and PERN stack with authentication and machine learning. I worked in the back end and the front end, specially in the home section, wishlists and favorites CRUDS, cart, social logins, searchbar, locations-stock logic and some other features. In this case, I worked as a dev lead for the group and learned a lot with the experience!
